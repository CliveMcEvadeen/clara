Here’s the revised project plan featuring **CLARA** (Content Language Agnostic Retrieval Agent), including all necessary features:

---

### **Project Plan: CLARA (Content Language Agnostic Retrieval Agent)**

#### **1. Project Overview**
   - **Objective**: Develop **CLARA**, an autonomous web scraping system that collects and categorizes text data in multiple languages based on user-defined parameters. This system will support deep web search, automatic language detection, content categorization, and organized storage for future analysis or natural language processing (NLP).
   - **Core Components**:
     - Autonomous web scraper with recursive, deep crawling capabilities.
     - Automatic language detection and filtering.
     - Data cleaning, categorization, and structured storage.

#### **2. Phases and Key Tasks**

### **Phase 1: Research and Planning**
   - **Define Requirements**:
     - Identify target content types (e.g., blogs, forums, news articles).
     - Define categories for data storage (e.g., general news, customer service inquiries).
   
   - **Set Up Technical Stack**:
     - Choose tools and libraries (e.g., Scrapy for scraping, Selenium for dynamic content, `langdetect` or FastText for language detection).
   
   - **Project Planning**:
     - Outline tasks, set milestones, and assign responsibilities.
     - Document system requirements for data structure, categorization, and error handling.

### **Phase 2: Web Scraper Development and Language Detection**
   - **Task 1: Build Core Web Scraper Framework**:
     - **Tools**: Use Scrapy as the main framework, possibly integrating Selenium for JavaScript-heavy sites.
     - **Deep Crawling**:
       - Implement recursive link-following to access multiple levels of content.
       - Respect robots.txt rules and implement back-off policies to avoid being blocked.
     - **Testing**: Run initial tests on sample sites to ensure proper page navigation and data extraction.

   - **Task 2: Implement Automatic Language Detection**:
     - **Language Filtering**:
       - Use `langdetect` or FastText to determine the language of a page’s content.
       - Sample text from each page and run detection before deeper scraping.
     - **Threshold-Based Filtering**:
       - Set a threshold to ensure reliable language detection. If a page is flagged as the defined language, proceed; otherwise, skip or categorize separately.

   - **Task 3: Data Cleaning and Structuring**:
     - **Content Extraction and Preprocessing**:
       - Clean HTML tags, remove ads, and extract main content.
       - Identify key elements of the page (e.g., headings, paragraphs) to retain meaningful text.
     - **Data Storage**:
       - Store data in structured formats (e.g., text or XML files) categorized by topic, language, and website source.

### **Phase 3: Categorization and Storage System**
   - **Task 1: Develop Categorization Rules**:
     - Use keywords, metadata, or simple NLP classifiers to categorize data (e.g., categorize into themes like news, FAQs).
     - Implement categorization rules and test on sample data.

   - **Task 2: Organize Storage by Categories and Sources**:
     - **Folder Structure**: Design folder structures by category and source for organized storage.
     - **File Formats**: Store each document as a text or XML file, tagged with metadata (e.g., source URL, date, category).

   - **Task 3: Automation and Scheduling**:
     - Automate scraping tasks to run on a schedule (e.g., nightly or weekly) for continuous data collection.
     - Set up a retry system for failed requests and periodically check for new content on target sites.

### **Phase 4: System Testing, Optimization, and Documentation**
   - **Task 1: Test and Refine Scraper**:
     - Run comprehensive tests on different sites to ensure robustness and adjust parameters (e.g., recursion depth, rate limiting).
     - Improve error handling for dynamic pages and adjust filtering based on observed accuracy.

   - **Task 2: Optimize Language Detection and Categorization**:
     - Refine the language detection model based on initial results, tuning for accuracy across multiple languages.
     - Adjust categorization as needed based on test results and data distribution.

   - **Task 3: Document System and Processes**:
     - Document setup, configuration, and usage.
     - Include maintenance instructions and future development suggestions.
